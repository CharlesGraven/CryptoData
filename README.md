-------------------CryptoData-----------------------
Author: Charles Graven

CryptoData is an opensource, simple python implementation of a data encoder. The method to encrypt utilizes comletely random filters, which ascii codes must run through to be encoded and decoded.

Currently, CryptoData could be considered light weight, but for simple encrptyion this project would be enough safety. For commercial grade encrption this software would not be enough. Again, this is a simple project, which I intend to upgrade and make safe for professional encryption eventually.
